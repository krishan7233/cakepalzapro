        <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        What started 5 years ago as a Sunday cake bake challenge by a cousin visiting home soon turned into baking cakes for family and friends on special occasions. As time passed, we knew this was our true calling and hence, Cake Plaza was born out of an unexpected and an unbelievable cake bake challenge that took place in the home kitchen years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Cake Plaza has reserved a special place in the hearts of not just family and friends but also happy clients all over India. As we delved deeper into this profession of baking and delivering cakes, we came to realize the loopholes in the entire online gifting system. And we – the mobile generation of today – knew exactly what was amiss and how could we help structure the system of online gifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the passage of time, we became a fast-growing gifting portal, providing you not just cakes and bakes but also chocolates, plants, flower bouquets, memorabilia and so much more. Apart from ordering as is, clients can also order customised gifts to let the gifts speak greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cakes at Cake Plaza have stood the test of time and today also, they are as delicious as they used to be. At Cake Plaza, the unsaid rule is that we do not compromise with quality. This shows in the list of ingredients we use to bake eggless cakes, tray after tray. We use branded high quality ingredients like Pillsbury Mix along with Rich Cream and Rich Filling so the taste – barring the huge variety of flavours – is always consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from relying on us for designer cakes, our clients get back to us for customised gifts that can help deliver the message across. These gifts are suitable not only for birthdays and anniversaries, but actually for any occasion big or small. We have introduced special cake and gift edition also for occasions like Rakshabandhan, Women’s Day, Children’s Day, Annual Days, and so much more you are bound to be unable to keep a count.
      </p>
      <p>
        We deliver to major cities pan-India. We also cover tier-2 and tier-3 cities for maximum customer satisfaction. All you need to do is, visit us at our online platform and explore options as per your desire on our smart and intuitive portal. Once selected, make the payment, choose the delivery address, and proceed to unbox happiness.
